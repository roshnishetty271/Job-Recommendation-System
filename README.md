Designed a Job Recommendation System where I have utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, and MongoDB to develop a dynamic web application. The goal was to enhance the job search process for users.  
The system is used to fetch job matches from various job boards based on the user's location, skillset, job role, and experience. By doing so, it ensures that the recommended jobs align closely with the user's preferences and qualifications. Rather than requiring users to manually search through multiple job boards, the system consolidates the results and provides the most recent and relevant job opportunities 
from the database. This significantly improves the efficiency of the job search process,making job searching faster and more convenient.
